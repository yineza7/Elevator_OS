# Elevator_OS

#### Authors: Ynes Ineza
For this final project, you will write a C/C++ program that will act as the scheduler for an Elevator Operating System. While the OS is running on the same machine as your scheduler, the core functionality as well as the simulation environment are written entirely in Python.  As such, data communications between the scheduler and the OS will be handled via asynchronous API calls.
